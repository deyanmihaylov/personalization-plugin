The Personalization plugin for WordPress by Flowcraft UX Design Studio allows you improve your conversions by personalizing parts of your site for different user audiences, based on certain characteristics of the users.



== Description ==
The Personalization plugin for WordPress by Flowcraft UX Design Studio allows you to segment and target different user audiences, based on certain characteristics of the users and show different content to each group.

The plugin is very easy to use and does not require any coding skills. Simply choose what content to display when a visitor meets a certain condition and what to show when the condition is not met. You also have the option not to show anything (leave your website unchanged) when the condition is not met.

Content can be added or replaced based on one or more of the following conditions:
- Country (free version)
- First time user (free version)
- Day of the week (free version)
- Time of the day in the user’s time zone (pro version)
- Time of the day in a specific time zone (GMT, UTC, etc.) (pro version)
- Specific date (pro version)
- Specific URL visited X or more than X number of times (pro version)
- User tries to leave the website (pro version)
- User’s device (pro version)
- User scrolls a specific % or a number pixels of the screen (pro version)


**With the [Personalization plugin by Flowcraft](https://personalizationwp.com/) you have the ability to combine different conditions with one another to target even narrower groups of visitors, which meet all criteria. In addition, you can add shortcodes from other plugins to your conditions. Providing personalized content to users is a vital step forward in improving conversion rates, bounce rates, user experience and engagement.**

**... and the best part?
You can track how your conditions are doing by using all the superpowers of Google Analytics.**


= HOW IT WORKS =

It is very easy to use. A shortcode is generated for every new condition you create that allows you to personalize everything – images, texts, pages, posts, products, prices, sliders, custom HTML, widgets and practically everything on the website.

The plugin works in few simple steps.

1. Click create condition.
2. Give it recognizable name.
3. Use the interface to choose your condition rules and combine them in order to target the users that you would like.
4. Use the editors "When Condition is met" and "When Condition is NOT met" to specify what to show to the user if condition is met and if it is not met. You can check "do not show anything".
5. Hit publish and paste the generated shortcode in your page, post, widget or where you want your content to appear.
